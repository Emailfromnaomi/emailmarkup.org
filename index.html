<p>Working to improve the user experience, accessibility, performance,
consistency, and reliability of email markup</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>The Email Markup Consortium (EMC) is a community-led group of industry professionals working to improve the email
experience for everyone. Recipients should be able to easily access the content of every email sent to them, regardless
of their device, email client, assistive technology or internet speed. The EMC collaborates with developers, creation
and sending tools, and email clients to drive this vision forward at every step of the email journey.

<p>Senders, recipients, and email clients share the common goals of improving user experience, accessibility, performance,
consistency, and reliability. However, currently there is a lack of cooperation in trying to achieve these goals leading
to inconsistent results. By working together on agreed approaches we can save everyone time, effort, and money while
delivering better results to the recipients.</p>
