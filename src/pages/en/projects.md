## Data Collection

- Project leader: Avi Goldman
- Project home: Private GitHub repo
- Sponsor: [Parcel](https://parcel.io)
- Status: In Progress

A number of projects we are working on require us to analyze real emails being sent on an on-going basis. We could not find a single data source that meets our criteria. That’s why we have recently started a new project to collect email data with the help of our good friends and sponsors at Parcel.
